To add a new pixel method, do these steps:

1. Add a method number in pixel.hh (#define DefinePixelMethods).

2. Implement the method in pixels/ .
	Either add it as a method in one of the existing classes,
	or add a new class that implements that method.
	
	Remember to update the traits in whatever class you modify.

3. If you added a new class, update pixel.cc by
	adding the relevant include file there, and
	by updating the #define DefinePixelClasses.


If you get this error:

pixel.cc: In instantiation of 'const<unnamed>::FactoryType <unnamed>::PixelImplCombFactory<void>::data':
pixel.cc:333:   instantiated from here
pixel.cc:312: error: 'getname' is not a member of '<unnamed>::PixelMethodImplName<void>'
pixel.cc:312: error: too many initializers for 'const<unnamed>::FactoryType'

It means that you have some PixelMethod that no PixelImpl implements.
